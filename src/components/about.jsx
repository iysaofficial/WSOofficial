                      Mastery of science with high integrity value is one of the main requirements for the progress of a nation.Development of National and International Achievement Centers, Ministry of Education, Culture, has made various efforts in order to develop the talents and interests of elementary school - university students. These efforts are made through various national and international competitions. WSO is expected to lead students to master science. This competition is also an important part of achieving talent and maximizing the potential of talented and character students from all over the country. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Therefore, through this systematic and tiered competition system, it is hoped that the widest possible space will be built for students to explore their abilities in the field of science and reach the peak of their best potential.
